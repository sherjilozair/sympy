    """
    Converts an arbitrary expression to a type that can be used inside sympy.

    For example, it will convert python ints into instance of sympy.Rational,
    floats into instances of sympy.Float, etc. It is also able to coerce symbolic
    expressions which inherit from Basic. This can be useful in cooperation
    with SAGE.

    It currently accepts as arguments:
       - any object defined in sympy (except matrices [TODO])
       - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal
       - strings (like "0.09" or "2e-19")
       - booleans, including `None` (will leave them unchanged)

    If the argument is already a type that sympy understands, it will do
    nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a
    function to ensure you are working with the correct type.

    >>> from sympy import sympify

    >>> sympify(2).is_integer
    True
    >>> sympify(2).is_real
    True

    >>> sympify(2.0).is_real
    True
    >>> sympify("2.0").is_real
    True
    >>> sympify("2e-45").is_real
    True

    If the expression could not be converted, a SympifyError is raised.

    >>> sympify("x***2")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SympifyError: SympifyError: "Cannot parse u'x***2'."


    If the option `strict` is set to `True`, only the types for which an
    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other
    cases, a SympifyError is raised.
